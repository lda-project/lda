lda: Topic modeling with latent Dirichlet Allocation
====================================================

.. raw:: html

    <div class="wy-text-large">

**lda** implements latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) using collapsed Gibbs
sampling. lda is fast and can be installed without a compiler on Linux, OS X,
and Windows.

.. raw:: html

    </div>

The interface follows conventions found in scikit-learn_.  The following
demonstrates how to inspect a model of a subset of the Reuters news dataset.
(The input below, ``X``, is a document-term matrix.)

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import lda
    >>> X = lda.datasets.load_reuters()
    >>> vocab = lda.datasets.load_reuters_vocab()
    >>> titles = lda.datasets.load_reuters_titles()
    >>> X.shape
    (395, 4258)
    >>> X.sum()
    84010
    >>> model = lda.LDA(n_topics=20, n_iter=1500, random_state=1)
    >>> model.fit(X)  # model.fit_transform(X) is also available
    >>> topic_word = model.topic_word_  # model.components_ also works
    >>> n_top_words = 8
    >>> for i, topic_dist in enumerate(topic_word):
    ...     topic_words = np.array(vocab)[np.argsort(topic_dist)][:-n_top_words:-1]
    ...     print('Topic {}: {}'.format(i, ' '.join(topic_words)))
